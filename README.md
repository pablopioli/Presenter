# Presenter
A simple tool for presentations written in Blazor

Sometimes you don't need full presentation software to show a couple of slides.
A couple of images in folder, a Blazor app and a browser tab can be equally effective.

Put the images in the presentation folder and use:
* CTRL + Shift + S to go to the next image/slide
* CTRL + Shift + A to go to the previouse image/slide
